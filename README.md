## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This challenge was fun because I got to play with grid a lot more. It is still something I have a difficult time grasping, but I feel much more comfortable with it in general the more I work with it.

One of the challenges I faced was with the mobile menu. As with most of my projects, everything is quite easy until I decide I want to add some animations or transitions.

### Continued development

I ought to learn a more effective way to create mobile menus. I feel as though my solution for this was not very optimal, yet it isn't very clear to me what an optimal yet simple mobile menu would be.
